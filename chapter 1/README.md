## Elements of Reinforcement Learning 
 
 + policy: function mapping state to action.
 
 + reward: environment feedback after receiving action.
 
 + value function: evaluate state, or state-action value in long term.
 
 + environment model: model indicating state change rule.


## Reinforcement Learning & supervised learning 
 + RL do has (sample, label) pair, however label might be uncorrect
 + The goals of RL is maximize the episode of reward rather than a structure information

## Reinforcement Learning & unsupervised learning  
 
## Reinforcement Learning & Envolution Learning
