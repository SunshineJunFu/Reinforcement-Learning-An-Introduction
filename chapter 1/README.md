## Elements of Reinforcement Learning 
 
 + `policy`: function mapping state to action.
 
 + `reward`:  feedback from environment, delayed, immidiate, represents the current action is good or bad.
 
 + `value function`: represents value of state, or state-action pair in long term.
 
 + `environment model`: define how environment work, namely, when receiving a specific action, the way how state change.


## Reinforcement Learning & supervised learning 

+ `similarities`: minimize the distance between prediction and target 

+ `differences`: in SL, each sample with one label, in RL, sample from interacting with environment and label may not be correct.

## Reinforcement Learning & unsupervised learning 

+ `similarities`: no need for label

+ `differences`: the goal of RL is to maximize the total reward, whilst UL is to learn certain structure information

## Reinforcement Learning & Envolution Learning 

+ `similarities`: 

+ `differences`: 
 
## History of Reinforcement Learning

+ trial and error 

+ optimal control
